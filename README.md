# Solaris


Solaris is a project I developed for a school assignment. 

It is a game which was inspired by an indie game named Solar 2. 

I tried to make it look similar to it but at the end I went a different way even with the whole objectives and mechanics. 
Still a work in progress as I am planning to keep working on it and perfecting it with a better UI, more feautures that make the game much more interesting.

The objective of the game is to get the highest score you can by eating planets and stars before the timer runs out. YOu have only 1 minutes to explore as much as you can. 

While you are exploring there is an army of meteors ready to hit you and destroy you. If your health reaches zero before the timer runs out you loose. 

As well as points, when you eat a planet, you will get bigger so it will be harder to avoid all those meteors. 

The game is played with mouse and a touch input script is ready aswell, but for testing purpose, it is commented.
