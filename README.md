# Solaris


Solaris is a project I developed for a school assignment. 

It is a game which was inspired by an indie game named Solar 2. 

I tried to make it look similar to it but at the end I went a different way even with the whole objectives and mechanics. 
Still a work in progress as I am planning to keep working on it and perfecting it with a better UI, more feautures that make the game much more interesting
